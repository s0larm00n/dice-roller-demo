# Dice Roller Demo

This is a sample Unreal project containing short dice rolling simulation. 

Only starter content was used to create this project, so the sound effects don't really match; however, full harmony was not the goal of this specific project.

There is no custom camera because the default free camera seems to be more than enough here.

### 1. Dice roll info
In this section you can see how many points did you get for each separate dice as well as total count for all three dices.

### 2. The container
Your dices are located in a container with glass ceiling - this is meant to gracefully restrict dices' movement.

### 3. Buttons
Buttons can be used to shake either the dices or the container.
